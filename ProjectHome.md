A project to design hardware and software which allows a 73kHz signal received on two hydrophones from shark tags to be filtered out and processed by a digital signal processor on an AUV.  The output of the system is the time difference between when two different hydrophones received the ping from the shark tag in an RS-232 frame, which can be to identify the heading of the shark relative to the AUV using trigonometry.
